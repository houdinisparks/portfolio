	Based on a harvard study (see below for reference), 1 in 4 kids drink
	no water during the course of their day. Our IOT solution was inspired
	by a game similar to the popular pet game “Tamagotchi” to encourage
	children to drink water regularly. <br> <br> The virtual pet
	is screened on the kid's waterbottle, and its status will depend on how
	much water the child drinks. This screen is connected via wifi to the
	kid's parent's phone so that the parent can keep track of their child’s
	hydration level and how much water they have consumed <br>
